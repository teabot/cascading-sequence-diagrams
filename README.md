#Overview
Created with [seqdiag](http://blockdiag.com/en/seqdiag/) and excessive use of `^‚å•H` in Eclipse.

Note that within the diagrams the 'client' and 'task' components represent the tool and job-task in MapReduce nomenclature. These are considered an abstract boundary point because as Cascading developers we rarely care, understand, or know what these look like internally. They are considered black-boxes, implementing the Cascading runtime on some execution engine but execrising the public `Tap` API in a contractual manner. All other components map to their respective classes within the Cascading API.
